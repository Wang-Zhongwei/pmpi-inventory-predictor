# Marketplace Product Inventory Prediction

A data science project for predicting out-of-stock products in online marketplaces to optimize advertising and improve customer experience.

## Background

Online storefronts like Amazon, Temu, Instacart, and Uber Eats advertise and promote select products on their home pages. However, in marketplace platforms that connect buyers to sellers but don't control inventory themselves, approximately 10-20% of advertised items are actually out of stock. This creates a poor user experience and reduces conversion rates.

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
- Predict which products are likely to be out of stock, so they can be removed from advertising lists

### Alternative Objectives
- Predict metrics on customer behavior
  - Build recommendation systems
  - Forecast next purchase date
  - Predict next purchase product type

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

### Running the Environment

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd pmpi-inventory-predictor
   ```

2. Build the image and start the Docker container
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   Start the container using existing image
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access Jupyter Notebook
   - Open the URL displayed in the terminal output (contains a token)
   - Typically: http://localhost:8888/?token=<your_token>
